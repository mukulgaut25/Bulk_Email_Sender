# Bulk_email_sender
Bulk_email_sender is just an another python script with very basic programming concepts. This script helps you to send emails with an attachment like an image or file with your specified email addresses.
As I mentioned this very basic unsanitized script so don't try to play with it.

## USAGE
This image helps you to understand how it works.


- First input it takes is whether you want an attachment of any file as shown in image
    > Did you want to send an attachment
    
Specify your answer 
- Similarly, if you want to send an image second input is for image
    > Did you want to send an image
    
- And then specify the number of email address you wanna send an email like i mentioned **2**
    > Enter number of email addresses
    
Then Accordingly provide the valid email address manually like
    > Email Address

- Script then wants you to give the attachment names for file or image or both as shown for .txt file
    > Enter File name
    
- Same input for image 

**Note: make sure that file and image which you wanna to send is always is at the same location of script to work properly**

> At last if the script executed successfully the you see ***send..***
